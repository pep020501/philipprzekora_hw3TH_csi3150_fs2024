        <div class="content">
          <p>Being one of the highest summits in the state, a nineteen-mile long drive up to the <br>
            Pikes Peak summit is one of the best ways to experience Colroado's breathtaking <br>scenic mountain 
            views. Explore not only the beautiful scenery but the various rest <br>stops and giftshops, including
            the visitor center at the highest point of the summit <br>where visitors have the option to grab something 
            to eat or buy souveniers. 
            <h3>What To Wear</h3>
            <p>Whether it's summer or fall, there is always guaranteed to be cold temperatures <br>and snow going up 
              the summit. Dress in warm clothes as well as comfortable shoes <br>as you do have the option to walk around 
              the summit if you so please.
