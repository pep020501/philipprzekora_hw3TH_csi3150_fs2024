        <h2 class="section-header">Pikes Peak Highway</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Being one of the highest summits in the state, a nineteen-mile long drive up to the <br>
            Pikes Peak summit is one of the best ways to experience Colroado's breathtaking <br>scenic mountain 
            views. Explore not only the beautiful scenery but the various rest <br>stops and giftshops, including
            the visitor center at the highest point of the summit <br>where visitors have the option to grab something 
            to eat or buy souveniers. </p>
            <h3>What To Wear</h3>
            <p>Whether it's summer or fall, there is always guaranteed to be cold temperatures and <br>snow going up 
              the summit. Dress in warm clothes as well as comfortable shoes as you <br>do have the option to walk around 
              the summit if you so please. You should also pack <br> sunglasses and sunscreen since you will be in closer
              proximity to the sun. 
            </p>
            <h3>Reservations</h3>
            <p>If you plan on driving up the summit between May and October with your own vehicle, <br>a reservation is 
              required to be placed at least two hours before your arrival in addition to <br> the purchase of a ticket.
              Additionally, shuttle options are also avaliable if you would rather <br> take one up the mountain instead of
              doing the drive yourself. More information on these rates <br> and prices can be 
             <a href="https://coloradosprings.gov/pikes-peak-americas-mountain/page/tickets-and-reservations">found here</a>

        <p>"This trip was personally a very memorable one. The views 
          up at the Pikes Peak <br> summit had to be the best scenic views 
          I have ever seen in my life. The picures I <br>took do not give justice
          to what it felt like seeing it with my own eyes. This was <br>a trip I will 
          never forget and wish that I could have stayed longer. I definitely <br>recommend
          planning a trip to Colorado."
